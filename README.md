# NI Ballet School
Stream One Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This is my website for a ballet school. The website tells the user about the school, how to get in contact via a contact form and details in the footer, 
allows the user to view upcoming class schedules and register for the classes.


## Demo
A live demo can be found at 


## UX
My goal in the design was to make information accessible on the site, while striving for a minimalist design.


## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap


## Features



## Testing
This site was continiously tested manually with each new piece of functionality in browser dev tools for compatibility and responsiveness.


## Deployment 
The live site is deployed on GitHub pages. It uses the master branch. It updates each time there is a new push to the repository.
