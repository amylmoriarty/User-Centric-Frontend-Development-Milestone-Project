# NI Ballet School
Stream One Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This is my website for a ballet school. 

The website tells the user about the school, how to get in contact via a contact form and details in the footer, 
allows the user to view upcoming class schedules and register for the classes.

 
## UX

My goal in the design was to make information accessible on the site, while striving for a minimalist design.

I made the decision to add a contact page and have the contact details in the footer for ease of access. 
Hopefully this would encourage somebody to pick up the phone for a quick enquiry while also allowing them to send an email for a more detailed message or get in contact after opening hours.

As a potential student I want information on classes for my age group.

As a parent of a potential student I want information about the teachers credentials and relevant vetting.

As an examiner I want to be able to contact the school with their students exam results.


WIREFRAMES HERE
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

### Existing Features

Home page - index.html The main focus of the home page is the banner to advertise the classes on instagram. 
I have used a bootstrap jumbotron with a background image and a link to the account which opens on a seperate page to allow users to continue browsing the website after following on Instagram.

About.html - I wanted to showcase the teachers experience here, I have also included the relevant dance qualification logos in the footer as this school is based in Northern Ireland and works with students of all backgrounds, 
I wanted this to be immediately obvious to the users.

Contact.html Users can get in touch with the school via the contact form or click the phone and email links below the form or in the footer.

Schedule.html Users can register for upcoming classes via email, browse the timetables for the classes and are reminded they can participate in the live classes on social media.


### Features Left to Implement
I would like to roll out the banner across all pages which can be edited/updated to notify users of changes as the situation progresses. 


In the future, I would wire up the contact forms to be able to send an email to the school. 

## Technologies Used

The jumbotron uses a background image which leans on the hero image tutorial here: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_hero_image.asp it was significantly edited to suit the style and layout of the site.
